Greetings all,

I know some of you already know about this event, and if not... my apologies for this late personal invite.  And, I already know some of you can't make it.  However...

I am offering crash space (before and) after the event.  Crash space is in Harwich, about an hour east of the venue.  Options range from comfy beds, comfy couches, floor space to tenting.

If you stay over we (we being basically the Acton D&D crew) will be hanging Sunday morning into the early afternoon, Jimi will be cooking breakfast for all, and there will likely be some drumming!

RSVP privately (watson@earthdrum.com) if you can join us!  And if not, we will be be hosting more D&Ds on the Cape, hopefully next spring and/or fall, and you are hereby officially invited to crash here for those events.

Shalom!
Chris
