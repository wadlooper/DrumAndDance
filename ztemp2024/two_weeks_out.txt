Hey y'all,

Two weeks out, and based on RSVPs, we do not have critical mass.  As I mentioned, lodging is tighter than usual for this event so I really need to coordinate sleeping spaces soon - please RSVP ASAP privately

Here's a quick outline of the plan, reply to all if you have questions or suggestions:

The space
- Pics attached, the entire wall not shown is a mirror (it's a dance studio)
- There are nails and/or hooks in the walls, Jimi is bringing a bunch of lights, bring more small lights  if have some
- We have access to the space for set up at 6, which means leaving 267 by 5PM (it's a solid one-hour drive)

The set list (same as Concord Warner's Pond gig, then we'll wing it)

- Fanga
- Yonvalu (I'll bring two congas)
- Kakilambe 4/4 to 6/8, and back to 4/4 etc.

Food
- Pot luck same as we did in the spring
- Saturday we'll need to have a late lunch/early dinner to get on the road by 5pm
